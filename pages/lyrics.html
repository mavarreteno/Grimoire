  <pre>
  It appears to me, quoting alarms
  The guillotine smirks in your house I smothered
  Sight unseen, sworn to harm 
  Ground to a powder, and soaked through the board

  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever trust my mercy
  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever trust my mercy
  When will you flirt with all thats burning'?
  Keep them safe and by your side

  Of all thats left, a lucid home
  Anectdote settles in the smear of this corpse
  If the larva speaks ask where to go 
  They mount the maker with a sulphur in fume

  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever trust my mercy
  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever Trust my mercy 
  When will you flirt with all that's burnin'?
  Keep them safe and by your side

  Of all the warnings that you gave me 
  With all components in the fault
  Have you ever heard me scrapin'?
  It'll be hard. To hold

  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever trust my mercy
  Don't you ever (ever), ever (ever)
  Ever Trust my mercy
  When will you flirt with all that's burnin'?
  Keep them safe and by your side

  Of all the warnings that you gave me
  With all components in the fault
  Have you ever heard me scrapin'?
  It'll be hard. To hold

  And all you ask is why, why, why
  And all you ask is why I'm certain you're holdin' on
  Mirror floats to the surface, heldin'on
  (Of all the warnings that you gave me 
  With all components in the faultHave you ever heard me scrapin'?
  It'll be hard. To hold)
  They lost the presence they were holding
  Looks like the tenants flickered off
  If the cell that holds me breaks me,
  it'll be hard to hold
